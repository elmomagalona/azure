Which technology is better, Microsoft Azure or AWS?
Both technologies have their own pros and cons. One must analyze which technology has growth and future.

If one technology has growth and future, then you can survive a long time. So the future is in your hands. With my experience and knowledge, I will recommend you to go for Microsoft Azure.

If you have taken the decision to get trained on Microsoft Azure, then join in MindMajix.

It provides free course on the basic level concepts and later you can enroll in their website for Instructor-led live training mode.

In this mode, you can interact with trainers directly, as it is an online training institute.

Trainers are well experienced and they can train you by giving real-time examples.
